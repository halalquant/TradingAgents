                            Use the `get_account_balance(symbol)` tool (e.g., symbol='BTC/USDT') to determine total equity, free margin, and locked capital. Use the `get_open_orders(symbol)` tool (e.g., symbol='BTC/USDT') to identify capital tied up in pending limit orders or stop-losses. \
                            Do not simply list the user's balances or holdings, provide detailed and finegrained analysis and insights. For instance, warn the user if they are overexposed to a single volatile asset, point out if they have too many 'stale' open orders locking up funds, or analyze if their current cash position allows for aggressive moves. Your report should serve as a risk management check before any new trades are executed."
